ðŸ“Œ Project Breakdown

We will follow these steps inside Jupyter Notebook:
Step 1: Load & Explore the Dataset

    Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
    Load the dataset and check its structure (columns, missing values, etc.).
    Clean and preprocess data (handling NaNs, standardizing text).

Step 2: Feature Engineering

    Extract key skills, job titles, industries using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    Convert categorical data (e.g., job type, location) into numerical values.
    Use TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/BERT) to vectorize job descriptions.

Step 3: Build the Job Recommendation Model

âœ… Approach 1 (Text Similarity - NLP Based):

    Convert job descriptions and user skills into vectors.
    Use Cosine Similarity to find the best job matches.

âœ… Approach 2 (Machine Learning - Classification/Ranking):

    Train a Random Forest/XGBoost model to predict job match percentage.
    Features: Skills, experience, job category, budget, location.
    Train the model on 80% of the dataset and test on 20%.

Step 4: User Input & Recommendation System

    Create an interactive form for users to input:
        Name, skills, experience, preferred job title, location, budget expectation, etc.
    Match user input with the job dataset.
    Display recommended jobs with a matching percentage.

Step 5: Visualizing Results

    Show top 5 job recommendations for a user.
    Display a bar chart of job match percentages.

Step 6: Save & Deploy

    Export the model for later use.
    Save recommendations for future enhancement.
